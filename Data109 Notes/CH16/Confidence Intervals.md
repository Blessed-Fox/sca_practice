### Simple Conditions For Inference

Perfect SRS
	No non-response, outliers, et cetera

Population is very large compared to sample

Distribution of variable in population is exactly normal

Don't know mu (mean) but do know sigma (standard deviation)


These are all Unrealistic
### Margin Of Error and Confidence Level

moe: critical value (number of standard deviations away from th emean that you are (how many deviations away from the mean are you)) * std. deviation (of sampling distribution)

X-bar +- (z* sigma over root N) over M

### Confidence Interval

A level C confidence interval is an estimate with some margin of error that estimates a parameter of interest.

Estimate +- margin of error 
	Want to estimate population mean mu 
		estimate mu with sample mean x-bar

CI = x-bar +- margin of error
	Confidence Level, C. Akin to a percent rate for finding the parameter of interest. 

Critical Values (Z*, -Z*)
Area between critical values is our confidence level.
