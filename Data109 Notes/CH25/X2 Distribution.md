### Two Types Of Variables

Quantitative Variables
	numerical values

Qualitative Variables
	Descriptive Values

## Problem Of Multiple Comparisons

Recall bar plots

Hypotheses
Ho: "No difference between the conditional distributions of the 2 Categorical Variables"
Ha: "Some Difference between"

### X2 Statistic

Allows us to find an overall measure of difference between categorical variables

## T-W.T.O.C
Helps describe relationship between two categorical variables via conditional distributions

Recall [[Conditional Probability]]. 


## Expected Counts 
E.C = (Row Total x Column Total)/Table Total


### DoF

(c-1)(r-1)
### Chi Value

"χ" ^2=∑("observed count" -"expected count" )^2/"expected count"
