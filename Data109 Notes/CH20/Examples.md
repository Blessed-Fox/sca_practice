### Waterslide Timing
Ex. SRS of 55 waterslides
Want to know average time to get down all waterslides. For this sample we find an average time is 47+-5 seconds

Assume it takes 52 seconds to get down.

N = 55
$\mu$ = 52
$\bar{x}$ = 47
$S$ = 5

Ho $\mu$ = 52
Ha $\mu$ != 52

Standard Error = $S\over root n$

$t=(\bar{x}-\mu)$ over Standard Error

t = 47 - 52 over 5/root 55
t = -5 over 5 root 55 = -5(root 55 over 5) = - root(55) = -7.416 = 7.416 (we take absolute value if negative) -> take to t-table -> p<0.001

### Marquette Age

Ex. Age of residents in marquette follows Normal distribution w'o knowing $\mu$ or $\sigma$, the Mayor claims average age is 35 years old. To test, mayor gets SRS of 40 people and finds the average age is 36+-6 years

N = 40
$\mu$ = 35
$\bar{x}$ = 36
S = 6
DF = 39 (n - 1)

Ho $\mu$ = 35
Ha $\mu$ > 35



### CI

Confidence Interval = Estimate +- Margin Of Error
