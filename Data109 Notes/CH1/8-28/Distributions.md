Types:
Symmetric (The Bell Curve) 
Left Skew (data avoids left)
In a left skew, the mean is less than the median which is less than the mode

Right Skew (data avoids right)
in a right skew, the mode is less than the median which is less than the mean,

Pay attention to the shape - does it have 1 peak or more?

Look for the center of the distribution

Look how variable/spread the data is - is it narrow and tall or skinny and wide?

Are there any outliers?
