#### 2 Main Types of Stat Inference
1. Confidence Interval
2. Tests Of Significance

#### Test Of Significance

For testing our hypothesis and determining if our result is significant or not


#### Statistically Significant
A result that would rarely, if at all, occur by random chance
#### Example: Pro Cola Testers


Loss of Sweetness from Storage?
Hire 10 pro-testers 
-10 -> 10, + loss, - gain

[1.6, 0.4, 0.5, -1.1, -2.0, 1.5, 1.3, 1.2, -0.1, -0.3]
X-bar = 0.3

Claim mu > 0
test mu = 0

#### Stating Hypothesises
Null Hypothesis, Ho
	No change / difference
	
	Ho mu = mu-o

Alternative Hypothesis, Ha
	There is some difference / effect
	One-tailed
		Ha mu > mu - o
		Ha mu < mu - o

#### Back to Cola Example
Hypothesis is that we lose sweetness (one sided), so Ha mu > 0
