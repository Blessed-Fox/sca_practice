#### P-value 
The probability that measures the strength of the evidence against Ho

Small P-value
	 Evidence to support Ha or reject Ho

Large P-value
	Fails to give convincing evidence agasinst Ho


#### Test Statistic 
Calculated from sample data assuming Ho is true and measures how far the data diverges from what we would expect.

	Large values of the test statistic tells us that our data are not consistent with the Ho

Large Z => Small P => Reject Ho, accept Ha

Small z => Large P => Accept Ho

#### Significance Level Alpha

Fixed value to compare the P-value against 

It can be whatever you choose.

If P Value is less than Alpha, the result is statistically significant, accept Ha

If P Value is greater than alpha, the result is not statistically significant, accept Ho


#### Test for Pop Means

Z = xbar - mu over sigma divided by root n
	Calculate assuming Ho is true w/ x-bar from an SRS of size N


#### Example: Bamboo and Fertilizer
Bamboo grows at a rate mu = 1.5cm / day, sigma = 0.25cm

Add fertilizer to 50 Bamboo shoots to see if they grow faster
In our sample
xbar = 1.6cm / day 
sig level alpha = 0.05

State hypothesi

Ho: mu=1.5
Ha: mu > 1.5

Calc test stat => P-Value
 z =xbar - mu over sigma divided by root n = 1.6 - 1.5 over 0.25 divided by root 50 = 2.86
 Use Z table, get 0.9979, 1 - z-value = 0.0021

Compare alpha
P < Alpha
Our result is statistically significant
