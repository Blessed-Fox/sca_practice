Comparative Experiments:
	subjects split into groups, where each group receives a different treatment.
Example test - 
	A new drug versus placebo

Involves Random Assignment
	Random assignment is assigning subjects to treatment groups, randomly.
		Makes treatment groups as similar to each other as possible
		Minimizes effects of lurking variables.


## Double Blind studies
Neither researcher nor subject knows who is getting which treatment. 
Expensive and difficult to plan out.
