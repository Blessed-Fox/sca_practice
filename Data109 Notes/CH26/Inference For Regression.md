#### Recall Ch4 & Ch5

Scatterplots compare 2 quantitative variables.

n data points
	(x, y)

If data came from a sample from a large pop, then we need inference to answer 
	Is there a linear relationship between the two variables in the pop

2. what is the slope (rate of change) that relates y to x?

3. how accurate are our predictions using the LSRL?

LSRL in pop

$\mu = \alpha + Bx$


Y-values vary according to a normal distribution. 

To Estimate the Parameters
	$\alpha$ ~ a
	B ~ b
	$\sigma$ ~ S


### Tests of Significance

Ho = "No Linear Relationship"
Ho: B = 0 

$\mu = \alpha + Bx$

Ho r = o
	because B~b, b = r(Sy/Sx)
	if Sy or Sx = 0, means all data are the same.


### T-score 

T =b/SEb

SEb = S/ root( sum of x-xbar)^2



### CI 

est +- MoE

B+-t(SEb)
