### Heater Repair Company

It takes a mean of 1 hour (standard deviation 1 hour) to do preventative maintenance 
	Mean = 1
	SD = 1

If we budget 1.1 hours for maintenance work, how many techs can get the work done?

	N(mu, signa over root n)
		N(1, 1/root 70)
			N(1, 0.12)

Z = x - mu over 1 - root N

 = 1.1 - 1 over 0.12 
 = 0.83

Take Z to Z-table 


0.7967
79.67% (80) percent of technicians can do the work in the allotted time. 20% cannot


### Cholesterol In Men

N(182, 37)

SRS (simple random sample) n = 100

N(x-bar) = 37/root 100

n = 1000
prob that x-bar plus minus 2 of mu

n x-bar = 37 over root 1000

z = x - mu over sd(root n) = 180-182 / 1.17
-1.71
use z table
0.0436

1.71
.9564

z1 (1.71) minus z2 (-1.71) = .9564 - .0436
