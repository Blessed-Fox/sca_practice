### Parameters VS Statistics

Parameters are numbers or values that describe something about the [[Population]] itself

	These use greek letters (mu and sigma)

Statistics are numbers or values that describe something about the Sample itself
	Statistics are what you actually calculate with sample data

	These use latin letters (x-bar, S)

#### P&S Rule

Parameters are to populations
Statistics are to samples

#### Statistical Inference 

Using sample data and calculations to infer something about the population

### Law Of Large Numbers

As the sample size (n) increases, the sample mean (x-bar) more closely approximates the population mean

AKA

As n increases x-bar approaches the mean

### Sampling Data of X-bar

The sampling distribution of X-bar is a normal distribution

Theoretically, we take every possible sample of a population, and take all of those samples means. It will approximate the normal distribution. 

The Mean of Means for your sampling distribution is going to be the population mean itself. 

#### Central Limit Theorem

When n is large, the sample distribution of x-bar is approximately normal
