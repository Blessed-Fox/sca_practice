1:
	0 <= prob <= 1, prob of outcomes between 0 and 1
			The probability of any event in a sample space is between 0 and 1
2: 
	sum(P(x)) = 1, the sum of probabilities of all outcomes is one
		The Sum of probabilities of all outcomes is 1
 3: 
	 Addition Rule For Disjointed Events
		1.if Aâˆ©B = 0
			then P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B)
		For 2 disjoint events, the prob of a or b occuring is the sum of the probabilities
	4: P(-A) = 1 - P(A)
		the probability of an event not occuring is 1-prob of the event occuring
